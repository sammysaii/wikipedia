                    <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Samantha Sai Hinay was born on March 25, 2003 in Butuan City, and grew up in Magallanes, Agusan del Norte, where she was raised alongside her two sisters. As a child, she loved reading books and music, spending most of her time immersed in reading and learning various musical instruments.</p>
                    <p>Samantha changed schools a lot because her family moved frequently to accommodate her parents' work and to be closer to relatives. She attended in Light and Life Learning Center in nursery, and attended Angelicum Montessori School from kindergarten through 2nd grade and again in 4th grade, where she consistently excelled as an honor student. In 3rd grade, she briefly transferred to Starland International School before returning to Angelicum. Following this period, her family decided to relocate to Magallanes, Agusan del Norte, where many of her relatives resided. Consequently, she enrolled in her first public school, Magallanes Central Elementary School, where she completed her 5th and 6th grade. </p>
                    <p>During her high school years at Father Urios Academy of Magallanes, Inc., Samantha distinguished herself as a leader, serving as Classroom President/Representative for two years and later as Senate President for another two years within the Student Government Organization. Her leadership and academic excellence paved the way for her continued success.                </p>
                    <p>In June 2020, Samantha graduated in Father Urios Academy of Magallanes Inc, and enrolled in the HUMSS strand at Father Saturnino Urios University, where she excelled, graduating as the 4th placer in her class. Building on her academic achievements, she chose to pursue her dream course—Bachelor of Library and Information Science—at the same university, where she continues to thrive.</p>
